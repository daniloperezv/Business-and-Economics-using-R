The codes and archives in this repository are based on the course _Topics in Economics and Business using R_ instructed by professor Víctor Macías in the University of Chile in 2019.

1. Perform an exploratory analysis of data, using graphs, maps, and elements of descriptive and inferential statistics.
2. Be able to extract data from different sources and formats.
3. Use R to estimate linear regression models.
4. Perform basic text analysis.
5. Build basic web applications.
6. Use R Markdown for reporting.
